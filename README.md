# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis is a project made for San Francisco State University CSC 849 Search Engines graduate course. Machine learning techniques and classical supervised learning algorithms were used. We first implemented a restaurant category classifier in order to predict the restaurant category label for a given set of restaurant reviews. We then use sentiment analysis to output the overall sentiment of a given user text review.

## Getting Started

The project uses Python 3.7.0 and the scikit-learn and pandas libraries. You must first install Python 3.7.0 in order to be able to run the project locally. You can download Python 3.7.0 here:
